## Slide 1: Title Slide
Replacing react-scripts with Manual Webpack and Jest Configuration

## Slide 2: Introduction to react-scripts
**Purpose:**
* _react-scripts_ is a pre-configured toolchain provided by Create React App.
* It automates the setup of webpack, Babel, and other build tools required for a React application.
* Simplifies the development process by abstracting away complex configurations.

Diagram Description:
(Optional) You can include a simple diagram showing how react-scripts abstracts away webpack and Babel configurations, making it easier for developers to focus on coding.

**Limitations:**
* Limited Customization: Provides predefined configurations which may not fit all project requirements.
* Dependency on Updates: Relies on updates from Create React App team, which may lead to version compatibility issues with existing codebase or dependencies.
* Performance Optimization: May not optimize build performance efficiently for larger or more complex applications.
* Debugging and Extensibility: Limited flexibility in debugging and extending configurations for specific debugging or testing needs.

## Slide 3: Benefits of Manual Configuration
1. Flexibility:
   * Customized Setup: Tailor webpack configurations precisely to fit project-specific requirements.
   * Plugin and Loader Selection: Choose plugins and loaders that optimize build performance and meet unique needs.
     
2. Customization:
   * Tailored Builds: Optimize build processes for improved performance and specific deployment scenarios.
   * Specific Feature Integration: Integrate specific features or optimizations directly into webpack configuration.

3. Performance Improvements:
   * Optimized Bundle Sizes: Fine-tune bundling strategies to reduce bundle sizes and improve load times.
   * Enhanced Dev and Prod Environments: Differentiate between development and production environments to streamline performance in each.
